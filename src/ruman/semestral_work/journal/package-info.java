/**
 * This package contains all the journal project functionality.
 * <p>
 * The main entry point of application is the class {@link ruman.semestral_work.journal.Main}. There a new JavaFX
 * application is created based on journal.fxml file. From there the whole functionality takes on the
 * {@link ruman.semestral_work.journal.Controller} linked from journal.fxml - all other classes are used for data
 * representation and other functionality used by {@link ruman.semestral_work.journal.Controller}, all changes to the
 * program should therefore start there.
 * <p>
 * Descriptions of individual classes can be found below.
